**iOS and Web Developer**

**Profile**

Passionate about technology and software development.  I am self taught iOS developer and have had 5 Apps featured in the iOS App store.  I am currently a student at Makers Academy and I am looking to forge in career in mobile development/ Web Development.

**Skills**

**Development**

Before Makers my introduction to code was through the iPhone. Since 2012 I have contributed 5 apps to the app store.  The process of creation and development felt empowering and self fulfilling. Little did I realise 4 years later that I would be embarking on a career in Software Development.

**Business Practise**

My MBA and my commercial experience over the past 34 years have taught me these key issues:

- Listening to customers needs.
- How to filter key messages to employees and customers.
- Implement Strategic messages i.e. Key employee and staff focus messages.
- Working with business software from the client perspective.

**Listening**

A key skill to any business  decision is to listen to customers and your colleagues .  This can shape your strategic and software decisions.  As we have learn&#39;t throughout Agile development the demands of the customer can change at anytime. My role as an Administrator enable me to achieve this. In that I was handling queries form employees plus liaising with our Head Office.

**Analysis**

As part of my role as a administrator I was called upon to make analytical decisions. These involved:

- Analysis of membership trend within the Health Club. Added administrative support from startup to a multimillion pound health club which has 6500 members.
- Improved staff retention by 20% by including a self improvement employee scheme.
- Evaluate new revenue streams eg Golf membership.
- Implement employee initiatives from our Head Office.

**Learning**

As my family will testify this has been my dream for the last four years.  Makers Academy is part of that journey. It all started with a small swimming app. Now I am learning about Web technologies.  Every step of the way I am learning something new.  Challenging myself to reach new goals and technologies.  For me this is the most exciting part of the journey. In fact I have been so thrilled about being part of this experience that I have decided to document it in a [Podcast](http://codecastmakers.libsyn.com/) and a [Blog](http://the-makers-journey.ghost.io).

**Creativity**

One of reasons I chose this career path is so that it would play to my strengths.  Being creative in solving business problems is an area that I thrive on.
