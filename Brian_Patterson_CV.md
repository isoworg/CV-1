**iOS and Web Developer**

**Profile**

I see that you have pickup my CV.  Before you move on, can I ask you to look around and see how well your team is working. The chatter of those that have just been on holiday, or watched what was on the TV the night before. Now I can be part of that team for the following reasons.

- I have a hunger and passion to be part of software development.
- For the past 17 years I have been working within the Health and Fitness Industry. It is with this in mind that I have an empathy of peoples needs.
- Understand the demands and needs of Corporate life.
- To create and contribute to a solution.
- Embarked on a journey that started in 2012. So self motivated and self taught in software development.

**Skills**

**Development**

Before Makers my introduction to code was through the iPhone. Since 2012 I have contributed 5 apps to the app store.  The process of creation and development felt empowering and self fulfilling. Little did I realise 4 years later that I would be embarking on a career in Software Development.

**Business Practise**

My MBA and my commercial experience over the past 34 years have taught me these key issues:

- Listening to customers needs.
- How to filter key messages to employees and customers.
- Implement Strategic messages i.e. Key employee and staff focus messages.
- Working with business software from the client perspective.

**Listening**

A key skill to any business  decision is to listen to customers and your colleagues .  This can shape your strategic and software decisions.  As we have learn&#39;t throughout Agile development the demands of the customer can change at anytime. My role as an Administrator enable me to achieve this. In that I was handling queries form employees plus liaising with our Head Office.

**Analysis**

As part of my role as a administrator I was called upon to make analytical decisions. These involved:

- Analysis of membership trend within the Health Club.
- Evaluate new revenue streams
- Implement employee initiatives from our Head Office.

**Learning**

As my family will testify this has been my dream for the last four years.  Makers Academy is part of that journey. It all started with a small swimming app. Now I am learning about Web technologies.  Every step of the way I am learning something new.  Challenging myself to reach new goals and technologies.  For me this is the most exciting part of the journey. In fact I have been so thrilled about being part of this experience that I have decided to document it in a [Podcast](http://codecastmakers.libsyn.com/rss) and a blog.

**Creativity**

One of reasons I chose this career path is so that it would play to my strengths.  Being creative in solving business problems is an area that I thrive on.
