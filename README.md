##Natalia Antonova

After working in architecture and design, I decided to make a change and start a new career as a developer. I'm a recent Makers Academy graduate with a passion for problem solving. I'm looking forward to making a difference in web development with an experienced team.

##Selected projects
-------------
|Project Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
|[ISpy] (https://github.com/5555482/ispy-game)|A mobile game for children (using Ionic and Protractor for testing).|

|[Takeaway](https://github.com/5555482/takeaway-challenge)|A web app Takeaway (text sending functionality is implemented using Twilio API).|

##Skills

I have learnt how to build web and mobile apps across two primary language stacks - Ruby (Ruby on Rails) and Javascript - and have extended my skillset to build a mobile app for children [ISpy](github.com/5555482/ispy-game) using Ionic (my final project).

Within this, I have learnt to implement TDD and version control methodologies (e.g. Git) and have a detailed understanding of key testing technologies across these frameworks (e.g. Rspec, Capybara, Protractor)
