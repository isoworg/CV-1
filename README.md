Junior Full-Stack Developer with an eye for design and a diverse background ranging from creative writing and street performance to personal fitness instruction and junior olympic training.

I am seeking a work environment that allows me to be myself and values me for my ability to make unique contributions. The ideal work-place would provide ongoing opportunities for learning while taking an interest in the mental health of its employees. As long as I am stimulated, valued and interested in my work, I will go in every day giving 110%.

Full Stack developer

Prior to learning how to program, I worked at Baltimore City Paper, an alternative weekly newspaper for which I fact-checked and made written contributions. My Bachelor's degree is in writing and the majority of my formal training is in the humanities and arts; however, I have always felt driven to find a field that involves nearly equal parts pragmatism and creativity.

I began my exploration of programming by doing as many free online tutorials as possible on HTML, CSS and Ruby and once I knew I had found my calling I applied to Makers Academy, the coding bootcamp. There I practiced TDD/BDD (using testing frameworks like RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine and Protractor) and version control (e.g. git) daily. Furthermore, I learned the importance of concepts like building a Minimum Viable Product, writing clear and concise user stories and constructing cohesive Domain Models, along with hours of remote pair-programming, mob programming and efficient git flow.

For the applications we built, we used two primary language stacks: Ruby and JavaScript. As a developer, I strive to write code that is self-explanatory (thus easily readable without excessive comments) and maintainable because I recognize the inevitability of change in a face-paced world that is becoming more reliant on technology by the day.
