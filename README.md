## James de Winton

Coding is the first skill i've been teaching myself and eager to learn since I left school a year ago. A year ago I was caught in the decision whether I should attend univercity or not, and I came to the conclusion ultimately that there wouldn't be a point in me going to uni if I wasn't passionate enough about a course to study it for 3+ years. Lost in a sea of different options coding caught my eye more than anything. I saw coding not just as a practical skill that makes you look very employable but also as a creative tool, used to paint the pictures of the technoligcal age, I saw the creative side to coding and with my passion for maths I decided to emroll at Makers. I'm only 19 so realistically I cant tell you what I want yet until i'm presented with options and have gained more experience in coding.
