When picking Hogwarts houses I can never decide if I belong in Ravenclaw or Slytherin, do I prize wit and learning above cunning and ambition? Software development is an industry, that in my opinion will appease both aspects of my personality as it requires constant learning, but also cunning to solve problems and debug spaghetti code. Going forward I want to be part of a company that codes in a variety of languages and offers full-stack development opportunities.

## Skills

#### Communication

I am a confident written and verbal communicator. These skills developed during university and have conintued to flourish due to my frequent blogging and public speaking. This is shown by a variety of situations:

  - I have lots of experience with public speaking, both as a group and as an individual. Most recently I presented my Makers Academy final project, <a href="https://github.com/Triffanys101/camping-app">Beyond Camping</a>, to roughly 30 - 40 people alongside my team.
  - I also have a talent and passion for interacting and talking to people on a more personal level. It was this skill that led to me becoming one of Boots top sales people during my time with them. I was often assigned to sell the star product of the week, one time achieving 31 sales in a day.
  - Since November 2014 I have been freelance blogging for Heroes and Heartbreakers, a website of Macmillan Publishing. This has been an amazing experience and has allowed me to develop my skill of informal written communication, as demonstrated in the following <a href="http://www.heroesandheartbreakers.com/blogs/2015/04/villainess-to-heroine-do-they-exist">post</a>. 

#### Problem solving

Another skill I possess is the ability to solve problems, in part because I can quickly assimilate information and discover possible solutions. These skills developed at school, through university and have continued to process as I was taught how to analyse problems and interpret information quickly. I have found they can be transferred to code and real-life situations:

  - One project I worked on while studying at Makers Academy was the development of a weather website. This website was written in javascript and to increase the aesthetic appeal of the site I chose to make the background responsive. Depending on the city chosen by the user the background would reflect an image of that city. Initially linking the Google image search API with the javascript dropdown was problematic as it was one of my first time using an external API and it required a callback to display the image. Yet as seen in <a href="https://github.com/Triffanys101/Thermostat/commit/87e1f8d4665fd03f21494482b17bbe3c3f10718f">this commit</a> the issue was resolved. 
  - When working for Character Wines I was asked to create the format and structure for one of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL6w0WH5D_M&feature=youtu.be">promotional videos</a>. The aim was to tell the story of the company and the process they went through when sourcing new wines for the UK market in an approachable and interesting manner. 
  - While volunteering in Cambodia (Jun-2012 to Jul-2012) I was part of Reach Out Volunteers whose role was to educate the local villagers, with particular focus on teaching the next generation. This was in part achieved through educated learning, in order to engage children of variety of ages we made an educational playground.

#### Organisation

I noticed during Makers, and at previous places that I naturally gravitate to organising groups and creating the plans. This is because I can empathise with other people, have a view of the big picture and naturally know which tasks should be given priority. Outside of Makers this has included:

  - After graduating from university I decided to go travelling around Canada. As this would be my first time as a solo traveller it felt important to arrange as many aspects of the trip in advance as possible. This involves planning my route across the country, organising flights when needed and arranging hostels to stay in. During my month of travelling I visited Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec City.
  - While working for Booker Cash and Carry I noticed the filing system was outdated and disorganised. This meant many hours were wasted trying to find relevant files. Therefore I took it upon myself to re-organise the finance department's filing, first by company and then year, making it easier to find the relevant information.
