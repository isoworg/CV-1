# Professional Profile
I chose to take a hands on coding course instead of going to university to get a more hands on approach when learning how to code. I’m a coding and full stack development enthusiast with strong understanding of integrating various languages and technologies to fulfil project requirements and resolve technical problems; moreover I’m more interested in working in the back end. Adopts a consultative approach to ensure specific requirements are met whilst focusing on exceeding expectations. An innovative strategist who has contributed to projects through application of backend programming knowledge, and ability to identify key gaps. Works well in a team without supervision, and excels within fast-paced and challenging environments.

## Skills

#### Communication
I communicate clearly with people around me, taking on the XP values when interacting with team members and pair programmers. I love getting feedback from peers, it gives me honest and positive feedback about how I can improve. Furthermore I am confident when it comes to introducing knew ideas to a group, as well as identifying problems.

#### Competitive
Since I starting coding and getting more into it, I've become obsessed in acquiring new knowledge and gaining a better understanding of things I don't understand; since finishing makers I have done small projects in Java, Swift and React, so I can move forward as a developer, throughout Makers I've quickly learnt new concepts. 

#### Team player
I love to work with people with different skillssets because it gives a valuable opportunity to learn, as well as being empathetic to help my pair programmer or teams learning.
