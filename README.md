I am a Ukrainian living in London with a passion for problem solving. After working in architecture and design I decided to make a change  and start a new career as a developer. I'm looking forward to solving real problems and making a difference.

##Skills

I have learnt how to build end-to-end web and mobile apps across two primary language stacks - Ruby (Ruby-on-Rails) and Javascript - and have extended my skillset to build  mobile app using Ionic(my final project: github.com/5555482/ispy-game).

Within this, I have learnt to implement TDD and version control methodologies (e.g. Git) and have a detailed understanding of key testing technologies across these frameworks (e.g. Rspec, Capybara, Protractor)

Completed every weekend challenge, using Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, JQuery, Node, AngularJS, HTML, CSS and more, all test-driven.
I'm a Git addict with over a thousand commits and a hundred-day streak
Blogged about my experience and personal development at Makers every day
