After working in architecture and design I decided to make a change  and start a new career as a developer.I'm a recent Makers Academy graduate with a passion for problem solving. I'm looking forward to making a difference in web development with an experienced team.

##Skills

I have learnt how to build web and mobile apps across two primary language stacks - Ruby (Ruby-on-Rails) and Javascript - and have extended my skillset to build  mobile app for children ISpy using Ionic(my final project: github.com/5555482/ispy-game).

Within this, I have learnt to implement TDD and version control methodologies (e.g. Git) and have a detailed understanding of key testing technologies across these frameworks (e.g. Rspec, Capybara, Protractor)
