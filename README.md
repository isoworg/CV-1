##Lucy Hargrave

When picking Hogwarts houses I can never decide if I belong in Ravenclaw or Slytherin, do I prize wit and learning above cunning and ambition? Software development is an industry, that in my opinion will appease both aspects of my personality as it requires constant learning, but also cunning to solve problems and debug spaghetti code. Going forward I want to work for a company that allows me to work in a variety of lanuages and offers full-stack development opportunities.

## Skills

#### Communication

I am a confident written communicator and also a capable verbal communicator. These skills developed during university and have conintued to flourish due to my frequent blogging and public speaking. This is shown by a variety of situations:

  - I have lots of experience with public speaking, both as a group and as an individual. Most recently I presented my Makers Academy final project, <a href="https://github.com/Triffanys101/camping-app">Beyond Camping</a>, to roughly 30 - 40 people alongside my team.
  - I also have a talent and passion for interacting and talking to people on a more personal level. It was this skill that led to me becoming one of Boots top sales people during my time with them. I was often assigned to sell the star product of the week, one time achieving 31 sales in a day.
  - Since November 2014 I have been freelance blogging for Heroes and Heartbreakers, a website of Macmillan Publishing. This has been an amazing experience and has allowed me to develop my skill of informal written communication, as demonstrated in the following <a href="http://www.heroesandheartbreakers.com/blogs/2015/04/villainess-to-heroine-do-they-exist">post</a>. 

#### Problem solving

I am a confident problem solver who can quickly assimilate information and discover possible solutions. It is a skill that was developed during university as I was tauht how to analyse problems and interpret information quickly. Yet I have found it can be transfer to code and also real-life situations.

  - Link to a difficult test (before and after)
  - Created the structure and format for a video for Character Wines
  - I made a playground in Cambodia

#### Organisation

I noticed during Makers, and at previous places that I naturally gravitate to organising groups and creating the plans against which we would work. This is because I can empathise with other people, have a view of the big picture and naturally know which tasks should be given priority. Outside of Makers this has included:

  - Pre-trip planning for Canada
  - filing system at Booker

**Interests**

- Social media
- Reading
- Baking
- Travelling
- Gaming
