## Jonathan Sayer 

An ambitiouse Experimental Physics Graduate looking for a career in Software development. Recently completed the Makers Academy coding course learning Ruby, JavaScript, Rails and Angular amongst other technologies. Currently looking for a position as a Junior Developer in a Company which will support further learning and provide an environment akin to a startup.

## Skills

#### Team Work

- Worked in a team to develop a mobile app which would learn a users regular journey and suggets interesting locations to visit, close to the users regular route. 
- The App was developed using an Agile methodology, ensuring all team members paired and worked on all aspects of the code base. A project manger role was introduced to promote communication between pairs, organise standups and assist anyone who was blocked. 
- Experience in using Github's multibranch system, analysing pull requests and dealing with merge errors. 
- During the team projects at Makers I learnt when to take the lead, and when it is more beneficial for someone else to lead on a particular task. I believe I have learnt to be a better leader by learning how to organise the team, breaking down the work that the team needs to do and ensuring effective communication within the team. 

#### Self-Learning

I understand the importance of being able to continuously learn new skills, especially in the Technology Industry.  Before Makers Academy I taught myself C++ programming. During Makers I was constantly learning new technologies such as Sinatra and SQL. During the Final project, [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-ionic) I learned how to use the the Ionic Framework to Launch our app onto a mobile device. 

#### Test Driven Development

All code that I write is test driven. I believe that test driving code ensures, clean, bug free code which can be easily understood by another individual. Tests ensure that all aspects of the code works and reduces the risk of any code being written which may over-complicate the end product. 

#### Ruby using a PostgresSQL database

[Chitter](https://github.com/jonathansayer/Chitter_Redo) is a twitter clone which allows a user to Sign in and peep (tweet). An understanding of Database relationships was essential to complete this program. 

#### JavaScript

The [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/jonathansayer/bowling-challenge) and [Todo list](https://github.com/jonathansayer/todo_challenge) were both using only Javascript. Jquery was used in the Bowling scorecard challenge and Angular was used for the Todo list. JavaScript was difficult for me and required more time on my part to complete these challenges. I recognise Angular, particularly, as a very powerfull tool and I enjoyed working on both of these project. 

#### Blog Writing
Everyday I was at Makers I wrote an entry into my [blog](http://the-makers-academy-experience.ghost.io/). This helped me to consolodate my learning and identify areas I needed to work on.

## Experience

#### Close Brothers (July 2014)
Intern July 2014
Interned at Close Brothers Asset Management for the Research Team. Responsibilities included writing a research report on the chemical industry for the benefit of one of the researchers and preparing a thirty minute presentation for members of the investment analyst team, and several Portfolio Managers, which covered an overview on the chemical industry and the larger chemical companies as well as valuating some of the more interesting companies. During my internship I met many people within Close Brothers including members of the accountancy, compliance and risk management teams. I also spent time with many of the dealers and portfolio managers so as to acquire a broader knowledge of the activities of an investment company. I also spent the day at the Bloomberg offices learning how to use their terminals, which I used to aid in my research of the industry and the companies. A Reference for this position has been attached below for you convenience. 

####Close Brothers Future Leaders (July 2014)                                               
The programme focused on developing skills such as teamwork, developing a business plan and presenting original ideas to large audiences. The programme brought together students from top universities, encouraged them to collaborate on original business ideas and work together to present these ideas to respected business leaders. As part of the course, I lead a team, which developed and presented an original fundraising idea to a charity, having only been given the brief of making the charity “bigger and better”. The course concluded with a gala dinner, where I, along with several members of the team, presented an original business plan to an audience of 150 people including four judges, who included Neil Davies, CEO of Leasing at Close Brothers, and Miles Jacobson, Founder of Sports Interactive.
