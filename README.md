## James de Winton

I have just finished my coding course at Makers Academy in commercial street. Here I have been given the experience in coding, especially when it comes to working in group projects. I’m 19 years old and eager to get my first job in a working environment. I spent my time at school (Wellington College and Hurtwood House) study Math’s, Economics and Media studies, in which I won a junior BFI for my group coursework. The reason I decided not to go university is because I personally feel that there wouldn’t be a point going to university if there is nothing I’m passionate enough to study for 3 plus years conclusively I decided against university because I wanted more of a hands on approach when it came to learning how to code. 

I spent lots of my time working on small projects in various languages. The language I have worked with include Ruby, Python and Javascript. I worked in a team that built a twitter API that would return the combined emotions of the 100 most recent/relevant tweets related to a topic searched, you can find the project on my GitHub (jamesdew12), we also deployed it to Heroku. Furthermore we also did another group project where we create Facebook with the same functionality other than messaging. In both of these projects I used different languages that I was new to, python and ruby/ruby on rails. I feel I have the ability to solve problems with ease, as I have a routine for solving them. In a group project we used an agile work process that included 2 day sprints, morning stand ups, evening retrospectives, option to pair, Trello board and 2 people reviewing pull requests before a merge, because of our work process in our Twitter API our final project exceeded our MVP by a long way.


## Education
My highest education is secondary school, I went to wellington college school before joing Hurtwood House for my final two years of school to study Economics, Mathematics and Media studies. In that time I enjoyed Maths and Media studies the most, learning statistics and core maths to creating a short film in Media studies, which even won me a student award presented by the BFI (Best creative director).

# Tullet Prebon, London (July 2016) Work Experience
I spent most of my time at the desks of the brokers', alongside some work in finance, customer service and app development for short periods. At the desks the brokers showed me the service they provided, their clients and how customers came for their price matching service. Furthermore the different desks showed me the different markets; I found the commodities and interests markets to be the most exciting.

# Castledown Radio (February 2016) Presenter
I presented a one hour radio show which had over 1000 people in the local area listening at the time. I played songs of my choice and discussed topical issues.
